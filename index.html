                <p>It's a joke in my family that I'm a "Professional Student"... I love to learn new things and like a challenge. 
                   It is one concept I want to impart to my children - that learning never stops. I have done many things, but some of 
                   the more interesting and rewarding things I have done to date have been earning my Commercial pilots license with 
                   an Instrument rating in rotorcraft (helicopters), obtaining a class B CDL, and earning a AAS degree with a 
                   concentration in Anthropology.</p> 
                <p>I have also done a variety of things for employment as well. While most of the work I've been involved in has been 
                   minimum-wage customer service type work, I have also had more engaging work as a tutor for the Surgical Technologist 
                   program at Renton Technical College, and as a security officer with the TSA.</p> 
                <p>I have many interests - I love reading Sci-fi and fantasy novels, and like to swim and hike. Now if only there were more hours 
                   in a day to do it all...</p>
